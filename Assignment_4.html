<h2>Part 2 </h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Describe two important differences between Java and Javascript.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Java code must be compiled, and JavaScript code is all-text.</li>
				<li>JavaScript code is run on a browser only, while Java creates applications that run in a virtual machine or browser.</li>
				<li>Java is an OOP (object-oriented programming) language, and JavaScript is specifically an OOP scripting language.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>Explain the difference between the + and ++ operators in Javascript.</li>
			<ul>
				<li> + is addition or Concatenate whereas ++ is increment.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>What are the differences between using window.alert(), console.log(), and document.write() ?</li>
			<ul>
				<li>window.alert(): the out put will be on alert box(pop up). </li>
				<li>console.log(): the output will be on the console.</li>
				<li>document.write(): the output will be on our web page.</li>
				
			</ul>
		<li>Explain the differences between =, ==, and the === operators.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>=: It is an assignment operator, used to assign a new value to a variable, property,.. </li>
				<li>==:typeâ€“converting comparisons, converts the operands to the same type before making the comparison. </li>
				<li>=== : is  a strict comparison, is only true if the operands are of the same type and the contents match.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>Describe the differences between two types of loops: while and do while.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>while loop: is a loop that start when the condition is true and ends when the condition is false. </li>
				<li>do while loop: is also a loop that run the loop at list once whether it is true or not.</li>
			</ul>
